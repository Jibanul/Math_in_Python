## Example: Taylor Approximation of cos function

The Taylor series of a real or complex-values function f(x) that is infinitely differentialble at a real complex number a is the power series

<p>f(a) + \frac{f'(a)}{2}</p>

Let, f(x) = cos(x) at x = 0, f(0) = cos(0) = 1

The derivatives of f(x) are,
<p>f'(x) = -sin(x) &#8658; f'(0) = 0</p>
<p>f''(x) = -cos(x) &#8658; f''(0) = -1</p>
<p>f'''(x) = sin(x) &#8658; f'''(0) = 0</p>
<p>f''''(x) = cos(x) &#8658; f''''(0) = 1</p>
